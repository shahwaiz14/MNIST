# MNIST
This is a 3-layer neural network. The input layer contains 784 neurons followed by 30 neurons in the hidden layer. 
The final output layer has 10 neurons. The model is trained for 2200 step using mini-batches of size 2250 and
a learning rate of 6.8.
The accuracy of this network (without the regularization) on the last five runs are: 90.95%, 90.33%, 90.67%, 90.32%, 90.74%.
With regularization term, the network's classification accuracy improves by 0.5% or 25 images in the test set.
